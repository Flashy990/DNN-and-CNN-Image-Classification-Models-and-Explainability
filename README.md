# DNN-and-CNN-Image-Classification-Models-and-Explainability
Before I began working on my spring 2024 research project at UMD, I tried to familiarize myself with pytorch and common ML frameworks. I trained DNN and CNN image classification models on MNIST datasets. I also tried messing around with Shapley and Grad-Cam explainability techniques as it prove crucial for my upcoming research project. 
This repository contains that code. Its divided into multiple sections and well-documented if anyone wants to follow along or understand whats going on.
